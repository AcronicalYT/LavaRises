A customisable lava rises plugin for Minecraft servers running the Spigot/Paper software.
This is a more customisable version of the plugin originally made for [Yrrah](https://www.linktr.ee/Yrrah)
If you use this plugin in your own content, please credit me by linking this repository and [my website](https://acronical.pages.dev)

Initialising the plugin allows you to set an area of length and width for the lava to rise, as well as the x and z coordinates for the centre of that area.
The raise lava command takes an input for the number of blocks you want to raise the lava by, the more blocks/closer to the surface, the more lag

To utilise this plugin, you must either be OP or have the following permissions:
 - lavarises.*
 - lavarises.initlava
 - lavarises.raiselava

This plugin requires [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/) (recommended) or [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit)
